        <p> In my free time I like to read intersting novels and nonfiction books. After I come from school and complete my homwork, I nomaly read books. I am 10 years old and study in class 4. Now I know that reading is a very good habit. I read books online as well as on hard copies. Reading books keeps me busy and happy. Books are a good sorce of enjoyment, knowledge, and inspiration. </p>
